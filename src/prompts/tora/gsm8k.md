Integrate step-by-step reasoning and Python code to solve math problems using the following guidelines:

- Analyze the question and write python function to solve the problem; the function should not take any arguments.
- Present the final result in LaTeX using a `\boxed{}` without any units.
- Utilize the `pi` symbol and `Rational`` from Sympy for $\pi$ and fractions, and simplify all fractions and square roots without converting them to decimal values.
- Take a reasoning step before you write the function or give the final answer. 
- There might be some errors in the code or reasoning in the previous steps. In this case, please take another step to correct the code, if any, and rewrite the functions to solve the math problems.

Here are some examples you may refer to:

Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?

<|assistant|>

To solve the problem, we can use the python code.
```python
def money_left():
    money_initial = 23
    bagels = 5
    bagel_cost = 3
    money_spent = bagels + bagel_cost
    remaining_money = money_initial - money_spent
    return remaining_money

remaining_money = money_left()
print(remaining_money)
```

<|user|>

```output
15
```

<|assistant|>

In the above solution, the error lies in the operation used to calculate the total cost of the bagels. Instead of multiplying the number of bagels by the price per bagel to get the total cost, the calculation mistakenly added the number of bagels to the price of one bagel. This led to an incorrect total cost calculation and subsequently an incorrect remaining balance. Let me correct it.
```python
def money_left():
    money_initial = 23
    bagels = 5
    bagel_cost = 3
    money_spent = bagels * bagel_cost
    remaining_money = money_initial - money_spent
    return remaining_money
 
remaining_money = money_left()
print(remaining_money)
```

<|user|>

```output
8
```

<|assistant|>

Therefore, Olivia has $\boxed{8}$ dollars left.

There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?

<|assistant|>

```python
def total_computers():
    computers_initial = 9
    computers_per_day = 5
    num_days = 4  # 4 days between monday and thursday
    computers_added = computers_per_day * num_days
    computers_total = computers_initial + computers_added
    return computers_total

total_computers = total_computers()
print(total_computers)
```

<|user|>

```output
29
```

<|assistant|>

There're $\boxed{29}$ computers in the server room.

Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?

<|assistant|>

```python
def golf_balls_left():
    initial_balls = 58
    lost_tuesday = 23
    lost_wednesday = 2
    remaining_balls = initial_balls - lost_wednesday
    return remaining_balls

remaining_balls = golf_balls_left()
print(remaining_balls)
```

<|user|>

```output
56
```

<|assistant|>

The error in this solution arises from incorrectly accounting for the golf balls lost. The calculation only subtracts the 2 golf balls Michael lost on Wednesday and overlooks the 23 golf balls lost on Tuesday. Let me correct it.

```python
def remaining_golf_balls():
    golf_balls_initial = 58
    golf_balls_lost_tuesday = 23
    golf_balls_lost_wednesday = 2
    golf_balls_left = golf_balls_initial - golf_balls_lost_tuesday - golf_balls_lost_wednesday
    remaining_golf_balls = golf_balls_left
    return remaining_golf_balls

answer = remaining_golf_balls() 
print(answer)
```

<|user|>

```output
33
```

<|assistant|>

Therefore, Michael had $\boxed{33}$ golf balls at the end of Wednesday.
