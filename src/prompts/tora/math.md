Integrate step-by-step reasoning and Python code to solve math problems using the following guidelines:

- Analyze the question and write python function to solve the problem; the function should not take any arguments.
- Present the final result in LaTeX using a `\boxed{}` without any units.
- Utilize the `pi` symbol and `Rational`` from Sympy for $\pi$ and fractions, and simplify all fractions and square roots without converting them to decimal values.
- Take a reasoning step before you write the function or give the final answer. 
- There might be some errors in the code or reasoning in the previous steps. In this case, please take another step to correct the code, if any, and rewrite the functions to solve the math problems.

Question: Convert the point $(0, -3 \sqrt{3}, 3)$ in rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(\rho,\theta,\phi),$ where $\rho > 0,$ $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi,$ and $0 \le \phi \le \pi.$

Solution:
To convert the point $(x, y, z)$ in rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates $(\rho, \theta, \phi)$, we use the following formulas:
1. $\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$
2. $\theta = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}}$
3. $\phi = \arccos{\frac{z}{\rho}}$

Let's write a function:

```python
import sympy as sp

def convert_to_spherical():
    x, y, z = 0, -3*sp.sqrt(3), 3
    # Calculate rho
    rho = sp.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate theta
    theta = sp.atan2(y, x)  # Using atan2 to handle division by zero cases
    
    # Calculate phi - introduce a syntax error by misspelling "acos" as "acs"
    phi = sp.acs(z / rho)  # This will cause a syntax error because "acs" is not a function in sympy
    
    return (rho, theta, phi)


spherical_coordinates = convert_to_spherical()
print(spherical_coordinates)
```
```output
AttributeError: module 'sympy' has no attribute 'acs'
```

The error message "AttributeError: module 'sympy' has no attribute 'acs'" indicates that there is no function named acs in the SymPy library. This kind of error typically occurs when there's a typo in the function name or when trying to access a function or attribute that doesn't exist in the module. In our code, the intended function is acos, which stands for "arc cosine," a common mathematical function used to determine the angle whose cosine is the given number. The incorrect acs should be corrected to acos.


Let's rewrite a function:

```python
import sympy as sp

def convert_to_spherical():
    x, y, z = 0, -3*sp.sqrt(3), 3
    # Calculate rho
    rho = sp.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate theta using atan2 to correctly handle cases when x = 0
    theta = sp.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate phi using the correct function name acos
    phi = sp.acos(z / rho)
    
    return (rho, theta, phi)

spherical_coordinates = convert_to_spherical()
print(spherical_coordinates)
```
```output
(6, -pi/2, pi/3)
```

The required form of the answer is $(\rho, \theta, \phi)$, where $\rho > 0$, $0 \le \theta < 2\pi$, and $0 \le \phi \le \pi$. Since our initial output has $\theta = -\pi/2$, which doesn't meet the condition for $\theta$, we add $2\pi$ to adjust its value.

Hence, the spherical coordinates for the point $(0, -3\sqrt{3}, 3)$ are $\boxed{(6, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{3})}$.

Question: Compute $1011_2 + 101_2 - 1100_2 + 1101_2$.  Express your answer in base 2.

Solution:
To perform this calculation, we convert the binary numbers to decimal, perform the arithmetic, and then convert the result back to binary. Here's a Python function to perform the computation with an intentional mistake:


```python
def binary_arithmetic():
    # Convert binary to decimal
    a = int('1011', 2)
    b = int('101', 2)
    c = int('1100', 2)
    d = int('1101', 2)
    
    result_decimal = a + b - c + d  
    result_binary = result_decimal 
    
    return result_binary

output = binary_arithmetic()
print(output)
```
```output
17
```
The function mistakenly outputs a decimal value instead of a binary value due to not converting the decimal result back to binary. Let's correct this:

```python
def binary_arithmetic():
    # Convert binary to decimal
    a = int('1011', 2)
    b = int('101', 2)
    c = int('1100', 2)
    d = int('1101', 2)
    
    # Perform the arithmetic correctly
    result_decimal = a + b - c + d
    
    # Convert result back to binary correctly
    result_binary = bin(result_decimal)[2:]  # Correcting the mistake by converting to binary
    
    return result_binary

output = binary_arithmetic()
print(output)
```
```output
10001
```
The answer expressed in base 2 is $\boxed{10001_2}$.
